# SwarmRL-Environments

SwarmRL itself is a package for building, testing, and deploying algorithms for studying intelligent colloids and various other active matter systems.
The first step in this process is building a simulation or experimental envronments which can take the SwarmRL models and deploy them. 
In this repository, we provide the environments that we have used or studies and are tested.
This repository will be updated as more are used.
